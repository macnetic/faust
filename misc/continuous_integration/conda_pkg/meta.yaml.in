  summary: 'FAµST python toolbox'
  description: "The FAµST toolbox provides algorithms and data structures to decompose a given dense matrix into a product of sparse matrices in order to reduce its computational complexity (both for storage and manipulation).  FaµST can be used to:

        - speedup / reduce the memory footprint of iterative algorithms commonly used for solving high dimensional linear inverse problems,

        - learn dictionaries with an intrinsically efficient implementation,

        - compute (approximate) fast Fourier transforms on graphs."
