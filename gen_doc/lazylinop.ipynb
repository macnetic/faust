    "# Using LazyLinearOp-s\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``LazyLinearOp`` class defines a kind of linear operator extending the scipy [LinearOperator](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from a ``numpy`` array, a ``scipy`` matrix, a ``Faust`` object, or potentially many other compatible linear operators with efficient implementatons, this class follows the *lazy evaluation paradigm*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, one can *aggregate low-level ``LazyLinearOp`` objects into higher-level ones* using classical operations (addition, concatenation, adjoint, real part, slicing, etc.), without actually building arrays. The actual effect of these operations is delayed until the resulting linear operator is actually applied to a vector (or to a collection of vectors, seen as a matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main interest of this paradigm is to enable the construction of processing pipelines that exploit as building blocks efficient implementations of ``low-level'' linear operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "LazyLinearOperators are complementary to other “lazy” objects such as LazyTensors in [Kheops](https://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/_auto_tutorials/a_LazyTensors/plot_lazytensors_a.html), or the ones of [lazyarray](https://lazyarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [WeldNumpy](https://www.weld.rs/weldnumpy/]) libraries,  which, to the best of our knowledge, primarily provide compact descriptions of arrays which entries can be evaluated efficiently on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook\n",
    "In this notebook we shall see how to create a ``LazyLinearOp`` instance, create more complex instances using various lazy operations, and finally how to apply the resulting instance on vectors or matrices. We assume the reader is familiar with at least ``numpy`` arrays and their operations.\n"
