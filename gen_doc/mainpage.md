\section intro_sec Introduction
 FAµST is a C++ library that implements a way to decompose a given matrix into  <br>
 a product of sparse matrix in order to reduce multiplication costs by the matrix. <br>
 FaµST can be widely used to speed up iterative algorithm commonly used<br>
  for solving high dimensional linear inverse problems. <br> 
<br>
 FAµST is delivered with Matlab wrapper. <br>
<br>
FAµST is developped at <a href="http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes"> Rennes INRIA</a> by <a href="https://team.inria.fr/panama/fr/">Panama team </a>. <br>
