    "# Using The GPU FAµST API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll see quickly how to leverage the GPU computing power with pyfaust.  \n",
    "Since pyfaust 2.9.0 the API has been modified to make the GPU available directly from the python wrapper.\n",
    "Indeed, a GPU plug-in (aka ``gpu_mod``) has been developed in that purpose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first question you might ask is: does it work on my computer? Here is the answer: the loading of this plug-in is quite transparent, if a NVIDIA GPU is available and CUDA properly installed on your system, you have normally nothing to do except installing pyfaust to get the GPU implementations at your fingertips. We'll see in the end of this notebook how to load manually the plug-in and how to get further information in case of error. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthy to note two drawbacks about the pyfaust GPU support:\n",
    "- Mac OS X is not supported because NVIDIA has stopped to support this OS.\n",
    "- On Windows and Linux, the pyfaust GPU support is currently limited to CUDA 9.2 version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these drawbacks, please notice that the GPU pyfaust support is still considered in beta status as the code is relatively young and still evolving. However the API shouldn't move that much in a near future."
