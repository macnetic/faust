    "# Using The FAµST Projectors API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook put the focus on the [``proj``](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacepyfaust_1_1proj.html) module of the pyfaust API. This module provides a bunch of projectors which are for instance necessary to implement proximal operators in [PALM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0701-9) algorithms.  \n",
    "A projector is basically a function defined from a matrix set to another (the image set is defined by a set of constraints to satisfy).  \n",
    "Each one of these projectors corresponds to a particular kind of constraint which can be of type ``ConstraintReal``, ``ConstraintInt`` or ``ConstraintMat``.  \n",
    "We will not address the constraints in this notebook however there is an important idea to keep in mind: a projector is defined by a specific configuration of one these constraints.  \n",
    "The reason why the constraints will not be introduced here, is because the use of projectors is quite straightforward and it is advised to use them instead of the ``ConstraintGen`` family objects.  \n",
    "Indeed these projectors matter in the parametrization of the [PALM4MSA](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacepyfaust_1_1fact.html#a686e523273cf3e38b1b614a69f4b48af) and [hierarchical factorization](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacepyfaust_1_1fact.html#a7ff9e21a4f0b4acd2107629d788c441c) algorithms, so let's maintain their configuration as simple as possible by using projectors!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next we shall pass the projectors in review, starting from the integer projectors.\n",
    "But first let's explain some generalities about projectors: \n",
    "- They are all functor objects (objects that you can call as a function).\n",
    "- They are all types defined by child classes of the parent abstract class [``proj_gen``](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/classpyfaust_1_1proj_1_1proj__gen.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pattern to use a projector unfolds in two steps:  \n",
    "1. Instantiate the projector passing the proper arguments.  \n",
    "2. Call this projector (again, as a function) on the matrix you're working on. This step is optional or for test purposes, because generally this is the algorithm implementation which calls the projectors. You just need to feed the algorithms (PALM4MSA for example) with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to define and use the projectors in the code. For the brief math definitions, I let you consult this [document](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/constraint.png).\n",
    "Remember that the projector API is documented too, you'll find the link for each projector below.\n"
