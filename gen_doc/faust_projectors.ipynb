    "# Using The FAµST Projectors API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook put the focus on the [``proj``](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacepyfaust_1_1proj.html) module of the pyfaust API. This module provides a bunch of projectors which are for instance necessary to implement proximal operators in [PALM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0701-9) algorithms.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Indeed these projectors matter in the parametrization of the [PALM4MSA](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacepyfaust_1_1fact.html#a686e523273cf3e38b1b614a69f4b48af) and [hierarchical factorization](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacepyfaust_1_1fact.html#a7ff9e21a4f0b4acd2107629d788c441c) algorithms, so let's maintain their configuration as simple as possible by using projectors!\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's explain some generalities about projectors: \n",
    "- They are all functor objects (objects that you can call as a function).\n",
    "- They are all types defined by child classes of the parent abstract class [``proj_gen``](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/classpyfaust_1_1proj_1_1proj__gen.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pattern to use a projector unfolds in two steps:  \n",
    "1. Instantiate the projector passing the proper arguments.  \n",
    "2. Call this projector (again, as a function) on the matrix you're working on. This step is optional or for test purposes, because generally it is the algorithm implementation responsibility to call the projectors. You just need to feed the algorithms (PALM4MSA for example) with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to define and use the projectors in the code. For the brief math definitions, I let you consult this [document](https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/constraint.png).\n",
    "Remember that the projector API is documented too, you'll find the link for each projector below. Last, if you're looking for a reference about proximal operators here it is: [proximity operators](http://proximity-operator.net/).\n"
