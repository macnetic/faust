<a name="installation"><h2> Installation on macOS </h2></a>

You can just double-click the .pkg file to launch the installation process.
You may need to authorize a non-appstore app installation into your preferences/security parameters or to right-click on the package for a one-shot authorization
 that may require entering your password.<br/>
Alternatively, you can also proceed with the following command in a terminal:

<pre><code>    $ sudo installer -pkg /path/to/faust-*.pkg -target /
</code></pre>

<b>WARNING:</b> For the installation process to succeed you should respect the default destination path otherwise the auto-setup script for environment configuration won't work.
Likewise, if Matlab has not been installed in its default path, it's most likely that the auto-setup script won't find it, see <a href="#installation_testing">below</a> then for troubleshooting.



After installing the package, you'll need to restart your Matlab or Python session in order to take into account the new configuration of your environment.
