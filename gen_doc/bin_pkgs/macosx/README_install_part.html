<a name="installation"><h2> Installation on macOS </h2></a>

You can just double-click the .pkg file to launch the installation process.
Maybe you'll need to authorize a non-appstore app installation into your preferences/security parameters.
You must respect the default path for installation otherwise the auto-setup script for environment configuration won't work.

You can also proceed with the following command in a terminal:

<pre><code>    $ sudo installer -pkg /path/to/faust-*.pkg -target /
</code></pre>
