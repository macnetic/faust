You can just double-click the .pkg file to launch the installation process.
Maybe you'll need to authorize a non-appstore app installation into your preferences/security parameters.<br/>
You must respect the default path for installation otherwise the auto-setup script for environment configuration won't work.
Likewise, if Matlab has not been installed in its default path, it's most likely that the auto-setup script won't find it.

You can also proceed with the following command in a terminal:

<pre><code>    $ sudo installer -pkg /path/to/faust-*.pkg -target /
</code></pre>

After installing the package, you'll need to restart your Matlab or Python session in order to take into account the new configuration of your environment.
