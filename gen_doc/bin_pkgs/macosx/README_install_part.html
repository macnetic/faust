You can just double-click the .pkg file to launch the installation process.
Maybe you'll need to authorize a non-appstore app installation into your preferences/security parameters.

You can also proceed with the following command in a terminal:

		$ sudo installer -pkg /path/to/faust-*.pkg -target /
