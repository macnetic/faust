<a name="installation"><h2> Installation on Windows </h2></a>

<b>WARNING:</b> Don't install the .exe to run pyfaust for python @PY_VER@ (the FAµST wrapper), it's only for Python 2.7. If you want pyfaust for python @PY_VER@ you need to install the pip wheel package (.whl, look at this guide \ref install_pyfaust_in_venv).

You can just double-click the .exe file to launch the installation process.
You may need to authorize the installation onto the windows panel opened just after clicking.
 That may require you to run the installer as Administrator user, doing it by right clicking and choosing "Run As".<br/>
Alternatively, you can also proceed with the following command in a cmd.exe prompt:

<pre><code>    C:\\> runas /user:administrator \\path\\to\\faust-*.exe
:: with administrator being the name of an account with Administrator rights
</code></pre>

<b>WARNING:</b> For the installation process to succeed you should have Matlab or Python (relevant version) set in your PATH environment variable (you can update it in Windows parameters). Of course if you want to use only the Python wrapper you don't need to worry about setting the PATH environment for Matlab and conversely. But note that if later you change your mind and want FAµST for the both languages you'll just need to relaunch the installer.

After installing the package, you'll need to restart your Matlab or Python session in order to take into account the new configuration of your environment.
