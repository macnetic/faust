<a name="installation"><h2> Installation on Windows </h2></a>

<b>WARNING:</b> Before starting, please close Matlab as it might prevent some files to be written during the installation process (especially if you are currently using FAuST). <br/>
<b>WARNING:</b> If you want to install pyfaust it's advisable to use the pip wheel package (.whl, look at this guide \ref install_pyfaust_in_venv).<br/>

You can just double-click the .exe file to launch the installation process.<br/>
You may need to authorize the installation onto the windows panel opened just after clicking.<br/>
 That may require you to run the installer as Administrator user, doing it by right clicking and choosing "Run As".<br/>
Alternatively, you can also proceed with the following command in a cmd.exe prompt:<br/>

<pre><code>    C:\\> runas /user:administrator \\path\\to\\faust-*.exe
:: with administrator being the name of an account with Administrator rights
</code></pre>

<b>WARNING:</b> For the installation process to succeed you should have Matlab
and Python (relevant versions) set in your PATH environment variable (you can
update it in Windows parameters). Of course if you want to use only the Python
wrapper you don't need to worry about setting the PATH environment for Matlab
and conversely. However the installer tries to install pyfaust and matfaust in
all cases so if you have not installed python or matlab don't be afraid to see
error messages (it is recommended to install Python in any case though).
Note that if later you change your mind and want FAÂµST for the both languages you'll just need to relaunch the installer.
<br/><br/>
After installing the package, you'll need to restart your Matlab or Python session in order to take into account the new configuration of your environment.
