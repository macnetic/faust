<a name="installation"><h2> Installation on Windows </h2></a>

You can just double-click the .exe file to launch the installation process.
You may need to authorize the installation onto the windows panel opened just after clicking.
 That may require you to run the installer as Administrator user, doing it by right clicking and choosing "Run As".<br/>
Alternatively, you can also proceed with the following command in a cmd.exe prompt:

<pre><code>    C:\\> runas /user:administrator \\path\\to\\faust-*.exe
:: with administrator being the name of an account with Administrator rights
</code></pre>

<b>WARNING:</b> For the installation process to succeed you should have Matlab and Python (relevant version) set in your PATH environment variable (you can update it in Windows parameters).

After installing the package, you'll need to restart your Matlab or Python session in order to take into account the new configuration of your environment.
