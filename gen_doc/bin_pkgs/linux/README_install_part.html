<a name="installation"><h2> Installation on Linux </h2></a>

Packages are available and tested for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Centos.

For rpm based Linux distributions like Centos, Fedora, you must install FAµST with the following command :


<pre><code>    $ sudo rpm -i faust-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION@-x86_64.rpm
    # or equivalently if you're not in sudoers
    $ su -c "rpm -i faust-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION@-x86_64.rpm"
</code></pre>

For Debian and Ubuntu which use *.deb packages you must execute the next commands:

<pre><code>    $ sudo dpkg -i faust-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION@-x86_64.deb
    # or equivalently if you're not in sudoers
    su -c "dpkg -i faust-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION@-x86_64.deb"
</code></pre>

If the package installation fails claiming libmatio dependency isn't found, you should install it through your package manager, typically dnf on Fedora, yum on Centos and apt-get on Debian or Ubuntu.<br/>

On Fedora:
<pre><code>    $ sudo "dnf -y install matio"
    # or equivalently if you're not in sudoers
    $ su -c "dnf -y install matio"
</code></pre>

On Centos:
<pre><code>    $ sudo "yum -y install matio"
    # or equivalently if you're not in sudoers
    $ su -c "yum -y install matio"
</code></pre>

On Ubuntu or Debian:
<pre><code>    $ sudo "apt-get install libmatio-dev"
    # or equivalently if you're not in sudoers
    $ su -c "apt-get install libmatio-dev"
</code></pre>


Other alternative, especially for old versions of distributions, not updated anymore like Fedora 24, is to install the static version of FAµST package.
It's needed because you could be stuck with a too much old version of matio.
The adjective static means that matio library and its own dependencies are statically linked/integrated into the package binaries so you're free to install the package without installing matio.
However it's not recommended to use this approach if you're system provides a sufficiently recent version of matio.
<br/><br/>
The static packages for this release are:
<br/>
<pre>	faust-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION@-static-x86_64.rpm
   faust-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION@-static-x86_64.deb
</pre>


After installing the package, you'll need to restart your Matlab or Python session in order to take into account the new configuration of your environment.
