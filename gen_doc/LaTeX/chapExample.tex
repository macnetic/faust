\paragraph{} An experience of Brain Source Localization using several gain matrices including FAuSTs and several solvers is provided. After configuring the matlab path (cf section \ref{sec:firstUseMatlabPath}). You can execute the matlab script \textbf{demo/Brain\_source\_localization/BSL.m} to run this experiment and \textbf{demo/Brain\_source\_localization/Fig\_BSL.m} to display the following pictures illustrating the speed-up using a FaÂµst.
In the Matlab terminal, you just need to type :
\begin{lstlisting}
>> BSL
>> Fig_BSL
\end{lstlisting}

Wich allows you to visualize this figure illustrating the speed-up with a Faust ($\mathbf{M}$ is the gain dense matrix and $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}_{6},\widehat{\mathbf{M}}_{9},\widehat{\mathbf{M}}_{16},\widehat{\mathbf{M}}_{26}$ are different Faust representing  $\mathbf{M}$):
