\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\paragraph{Presentation:}FA$\mu$ST is a C++ toolbox, useful to decompose a given dense matrix into a product of sparse matrices in order to reduce its computational complexity (both for storage and manipulation). In Figure \ref{fig:presentation}, the matrix \textbf{A} represents the dense matrix and $\mathbf{S_j}$ correspond to the sparse matrices as $\mathbf{A}=\prod_{j=1}^J\mathbf{S_j}$.

FA$\mu$ST can be used to speed up iterative algorithms commonly used for solving high dimensional linear inverse problems. The algorithms implemented in the toolbox are described in details by Le Magoarou.\cite{LeMagoarou2016}.
The FA$\mu$ST toolbox is delivered with a Matlab wrapper.

\paragraph{FA$\mu$ST Structure:}
The Figure \ref{fig:faustStructure} presents an brief structure of the FA$\mu$ST toolbox. The principal C++ library called "libfaust" includes two components: the "Factorization algorithms" is used to generate a FA$\mu$ST core from a dense matrix and the "FA$\mu$ST matrix multiplication" provides the linear operator to manipulate your data. It can be employ using different types of wrappers but in the second version of FA$\mu$ST package (Version 2.0), only Matlab wrapper is provided.

\paragraph{Valid Installation: Platforms, Compiler and IDE}
The Figure \ref{fig:recapInstall} summarizes the tested configurations of the installation of the FA$\mu$ST toolbox following the type of platform (Linux, Mac or Windows), compiler, version of Matlab and the type of Integrate Development Environment (IDE).\\
Choose among this Figure \ref{fig:recapInstall} the adapted platform and IDE following your system and refer to the corresponding Install Chapter. Authors suggest the installation using the GCC or Clang compiler directly from a command terminal because it is more simple and requires fewer externals components. 

The installation on Windows Platform using Visual Studio IDE has been tested but there is compilation problems depending of the version of your Windows and your Visual Studio. This install configuration is not guaranteed but you can try and report any problem and/or suggestion on install-list of FA$\mu$ST project on \url{http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/faust-install/}.

\paragraph{Organization:}Chapter \ref{sec:InstallUnix} explains how to install the library FA$\mu$ST for UNIX platform and Chapter \ref{sec:WinInstall} corresponds to the Windows installation. Chapter \ref{sec:firstUse} shows quickly how to use this library and finally an example is given Chapter \ref{sec:example}.
