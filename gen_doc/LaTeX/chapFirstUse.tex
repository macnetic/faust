\chapter{QuickStart}\label{sec:firstUse}


A matlab wrapper is delivered with the FAUST C++ library.
It provides a user friendly new class of matrix \textbf{matlab{\_}faust} efficient for the multiplication with matlab built-in dense matrix class.\newline
\newline
As much as possible, a \textbf{matlab{\_}faust} object is handled as a normal matlab matrix, here is listing of matlab builtin function that can be applied to a faust A :



\begin{lstlisting}
>> % considering A is a Faust of size 10x3
>>
>> % get the size of the faust
>> [dim1,dim2] = size(A);
>>
>> %  transpose a faust  
>> A_trans = A'; 		 
>> 
>> % multiplication by A
>> x1 = rand(3,3);
>> y1 = A*x1;  
>> 
>> % multiplication by A'
>> x2 = rand(10,5);
>> y2 = A'*x2;
>>
>>
>> % get the coefficient i,j and slicing for reading purpose
>> coeff=A(i,j);
>> col_2=A(:,2);
>> submatrix_A=A(3:5,2:3);
>> % Warning :  A(i,j)=3 will not modify A, writing is not allowed
>> % Warning :  A(end,end) give the wrong result   
\end{lstlisting}



\section{construct a faust}\label{sec:firstUseBuild}

A \textbf{matlab{\_}faust} object can be constructed from several ways.
\subsection{construct a faust from a cell-array}\label{sec:firstUseBuildFromCellArray}
First, you can build a faust from a cell-array of matlab matrix (sparse or dense) representing its factors.
\newline
\newline
The following example shows how to build a random faust of size 5x3 with 3 factors :
\begin{lstlisting}
>> nb_factor = 3;
>> dim1 = 5;
>> dim2 = 3; 
>>
>> % list of factors
>> factors = cell(nb_factor);
>>
>> factors{1}=rand(dim1,dim2); % first factor is rectangular 
>> for i=2:nb_factor
>> 		factors{i}=rand(dim2,dim2);
>> end
>>
>> % build the faust
>> A=Faust(factors);
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage

An optional multiplying scalar argument can be taken into account  :
\begin{lstlisting}
>> % multiplicative scalar
>> lambda = 3.5 
>> % build the faust
>> A=Faust(factors,lambda);
\end{lstlisting}

This functionality allows you to build a faust from the factorization algorithm :
\textbf{mexHierarchical{\_}fact} or \textbf{mexPalm4MSA} :
\begin{lstlisting}
>> % factorization step
>> [lambda,factors]=mexHierarchical_fact(params);
>> % build the faust corresponding to the factorization
>> A=Faust(factors,lambda);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{construct a faust from a saved one}\label{sec:firstUseBuildFromSave}

You can also build a faust from a previously one which is saved into a mat file :
\begin{lstlisting}
>> %  save the faust A into the file faust.mat
>> [lambda,factors]=save(A,'faust.mat');
>> % create a new faust from the file faust.mat
>> A_loaded=Faust('faust.mat');
\end{lstlisting}
