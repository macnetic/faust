Weâll see at the end of  this tutorial how to load manually the module and how to get further information in case of an error.</span></div><div  class = 'S1'><span>It is worthy to note that Mac OS X is not supported because NVIDIA has stopped to support this OS.</span></div><div  class = 'S1'><span>Also please notice that the GPU module support is still considered in beta status as the code is relatively young and still evolving.

% 
% 
% In this tutorial weâll see quickly how to leverage the GPU computing power 
% with matfaust. Since matfaust 3.0.0 the API has been modified to make the GPU 
% available directly from the Matlab wrapper. Indeed, an independent GPU module 
% (aka |gpu_mod|) has been developed for this purpose.
% 
% The first question you might ask is: does it work on my computer?  Here is 
% the answer: the loading of this module is quite transparent, if an NVIDIA GPU 
% is available and CUDA (11 or 12) is properly installed on your  system, you 
% have normally nothing to do except installing matfaust to get the GPU implementations 
% at your fingertips. Weâll see at the end of  this tutorial how to load manually 
% the module and how to get further information in case of an error.
% 
% It is worthy to note that Mac OS X is not supported because NVIDIA has stopped 
% to support this OS.
% 
% Also please notice that the GPU module support is still considered in beta 
% status as the code is relatively young and still evolving. However the API shouldnât 
% evolve that much in a near future.
% 1. Creating a GPU Faust object
% 
% 
% Letâs start with some basic Faust creations on the GPU. Almost all the  ways 
% of creating a Faust object in CPU memory are also available to create a GPU 
% Faust. First of all, creating a Faust using the constructor works seamlessly 
% on GPU, the only need is to specify the |dev| keyword argument, as follows:

import matfaust.Faust
M = rand(10, 10);
N = rand(10, 15);
gpuF = Faust({M, N}, 'dev', 'gpu')
%% 
% Itâs clearly indicated in the output that the Faust object is instantiated 
% in GPU memory (the N and M numpy arrays are copied from the CPU to the GPU memory). 
% However itâs also possible to check this programmatically:

device(gpuF)
%% 
% While for a CPU Faust youâll get:

device(Faust({M, N}, 'dev', 'cpu'))
%% 
% In |gpuF| the factors are dense matrices but itâs totally possible to instantiate 
% sparse matrices on the GPU as you can do on CPU side.

S = sprand(10, 15, .25);
T = sprand(15, 10, .05);
sparse_gpuF = Faust({S, T}, 'dev', 'gpu')
%% 
% You can also create a GPU Faust by explicitly copying a CPU Faust to the GPU 
% memory. Actually, at anytime you can copy a CPU Faust to GPU and  conversely. 
% The |clone()| member function is here precisely for this purpose. Below we copy 
% |gpuF| to CPU and back again to GPU in the new Faust |gpuF2|.

cpuF = clone(gpuF, 'cpu')
 gpuF2 = clone(cpuF, 'gpu')
% 2. Generating a GPU Faust
% 
% 
% Many of the functions for generating a Faust object on CPU are available on 
% GPU too. It is always the same, you precise the |dev| argument by assigning 
% the |'gpu'| value and youâll get a GPU Faust instead of a CPU Faust.
% 
% For example, the code below will successively create a random GPU Faust, a 
% Hadamard transform GPU Faust, an identity GPU Faust and finally a DFT GPU Faust.

import matfaust.wht
import matfaust.dft
% Random GPU Faust
matfaust.rand(10, 10, 'num_factors', 11, 'dev', 'gpu')
% Hadamard GPU Faust
wht(32, 'dev', 'gpu')
% Identity GPU Faust
matfaust.eye(16, 'dev', 'gpu')
% DFT GPU Faust
dft(32, 'dev', 'gpu')
% *3. Manipulating GPU Fausts and CPU interoperability*
% Once youâve created GPU Faust objects, you can perform operations on them 
% staying in GPU world (that is, with no array transfer to CPU memory). Thatâs 
% of course not always possible.
% 
% For example, letâs consider Faust-scalar multiplication and  Faust-matrix 
% product. In the first case the scalar is copied to the GPU memory and likewise 
% in the second case the matrix is copied from CPU to GPU in order to proceed 
% to the computation. However in both cases the Faust factors stay into GPU memory 
% and donât move during the computation.

% Faust-scalar multiplication
2*gpuF
%% 
% When you make a scalar multiplication only one factor is multiplied, the others 
% donât change, they are shared between the Faust being multiplied and the resulting 
% Faust. This is an optimization and to go further in  this direction the factor 
% chosen to be multiplied is the smallest in memory (not necessarily the first 
% one).

% Faust-matrix product (the matrix is copied to GPU
% then the multiplication is performed on GPU)
gpuF*rand(size(gpuF,2), 15)
%% 
% On the contrary, and that matters for optimization, there is no CPU-GPU  transfer 
% at all when you create another GPU Faust named for example |gpuF2| on the GPU 
% and decide to multiply the two of them like this:

gpuF2 = matfaust.rand(size(gpuF, 2), 18, 'dev', 'gpu')
gpuF3 = gpuF * gpuF2
%% 
% Besides, itâs important to note that |gpuF3| factors are not duplicated in 
% memory because they already exist for |gpuF| and |gpuF2|, thatâs an extra optimization: 
% |gpuF3| is just a memory view of the factors of |gpuF| and |gpuF2| (the same 
% GPU arrays are shared between |Faust| objects). That works pretty well the same 
% for CPU |Faust| objects.
% 
% Finally, please notice that CPU Faust objects are not directly interoperable 
% with GPU Fausts objects. You can try, itâll end up with an error.

cpuF = matfaust.rand(5, 5, 'num_factors', 5, 'dev', 'cpu');
gpuF = matfaust.rand(5, 5, 'num_factors', 6, 'dev', 'gpu');
% A first try to multiply a CPU Faust with a GPU one...
cpuF * gpuF
%% 
% It doesn't work, you must either convert |cpuF| to a GPU Faust or |gpuF| to 
% a CPU Faust before multiplying. Below is a second try using conversion as needed...

clone(cpuF, 'gpu') * gpuF
%% 
% Now it works!
% 4. Benchmarking your GPU with matfaust!
% 
% 
% Of course when we run some code on GPU rather than on CPU, it is clearly to 
% enhance the performance. So letâs try your GPU and find out if it is worth it 
% or not compared to your CPU. First, measure how much time it takes on CPU to 
% compute a Faust norm and the dense array corresponding to the product of its 
% factors:

cpuF = matfaust.rand(1024, 1024, 'num_factors', 10, 'fac_type', 'dense');
timeit(@() norm(cpuF, 2))
timeit(@() full(cpuF))
%% 
% Now letâs make some GPU heat with norms and matrix products!

gpuF = clone(cpuF, 'dev', 'gpu');
timeit(@() norm(gpuF, 2))
timeit(@() full(gpuF))
%% 
% Of course not all GPUs are equal. For example, on a Tesla V100 I've got respectively 
% 7.6e-3 and 1.03e-2 seconds for the 2-norm and the |full| array.
% 
% Likewise letâs compare the performance obtained for a sparse Faust:

cpuF2 = matfaust.rand(1024, 1024, 'num_factors', 10, 'fac_type', 'sparse');
gpuF2 = clone(cpuF2, 'dev', 'gpu');
timeit(@() norm(gpuF2, 2))
timeit(@() full(gpuF2))
% *5. Running some FAÂµST algorithms on GPU*
% 
% 
% Some of the FAÂµST algorithms implemented in the C++ core are now also available 
% in pure GPU mode.
% 
% For example, letâs compare the factorization times taken by the hierarchical 
% factorization when launched on CPU and GPU.
% 
% When running on GPU, the matrix to factorize is copied in GPU memory and almost 
% all operations executed during the algorithm donât imply the CPU in any manner 
% (the only exception at this stage of development is the proximal operators that 
% only run on CPU).
% 
% First please copy the following function in the appropriate filename |factorize_MEG.m| 
% into in the current working directory of Matlab (or by adding the destination 
% directory to your path by calling |addpath|).
% 
% |function [MEG16, total_time, err] = factorize_MEG(dev)|
% 
% |import matfaust.fact.hierarchical|
% 
% |import matfaust.factparams.ParamsHierarchicalRectMat|
% 
% |load('matrix_MEG.mat')|
% 
% |MEG = matrix.';|
% 
% |num_facts = 9;|
% 
% |k = 10;|
% 
% |s = 8;|
% 
% |tic|
% 
% |p = ParamsHierarchicalRectMat.createParams(MEG, {'rectmat', num_facts, k, 
% s});|
% 
% |MEG16 = hierarchical(MEG, p, 'backend', 2020, 'gpu', strcmp(dev, 'gpu'));|
% 
% |total_time = toc;|
% 
% |err = norm(MEG16-MEG, 'fro')/norm(MEG, 'fro');|
% 
% |end|
% 
% |Now we can run the hierarchical algorithm on CPU and then GPU. For more information 
% about this algorithm please consult the| <https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacematfaust_1_1fact.html#a2b2101831c564836ca022ae4f7a7f010 
% |API doc|>|.|
% 
% *Warning: THE COMPUTATION CAN LAST TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES OR SO ON CPU*

[MEG16, total_time, err] = factorize_MEG('cpu')
%%
[MEG16, total_time, err] = factorize_MEG('gpu')
%% 
% For the comparison here are the results I got on a Tesla V100 GPU:
%% 
% |[~, total_time, err] = factorize_MEG('gpu')|
% 
% 
% 
% |total_time =|
% 
% 
% 
% |49.49|
% 
% 
% 
% |err =|
% 
% 
% 
% |0.1296|
% 
% 
% 
% As you see itâs far faster than with the CPU!
% *6. Manually loading the matfaust GPU module*
% If something goes wrong when trying to use the GPU matfaust extension, here 
% is how to manually load the module and obtain more  information.
% 
% The key is the function <https://faustgrp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/faust/last-doc/html/namespacematfaust.html#a75568ecea590cd9f9cd14dce87bfdc84 
% enable_gpu_mod>.
% 
% This function allows to give another try to |gpu_mod| loading with the verbose 
% mode enabled.
% 
% Below I copy output that show what it should look like when it doesnât work:
% 
% |matfaust.enable_gpu_mod('silent', false)|
% 
% |Output:|
% 
% |WARNING: you must call enable_gpu_mod() before using GPUModHandler singleton.|
% 
% |loading libgm|
% 
% |libgm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory|
