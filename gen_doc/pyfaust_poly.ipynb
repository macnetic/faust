    "# Using the poly module\n",
    "\n",
    "A new module has been added to pyfaust version 3.1.x. Its name is ``poly`` and as expected it is dedicated to a kind of Fausts that are defined according to series of polynomials. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll see how to use the main functions of this module then we'll introduce one precise use case with the action of exponential matrix on a vector / matrix.\n",

    "**NOTE**: all the functions introduced in this notebook are available on GPU, using the ``dev='gpu'`` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The basis function\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the ``poly`` module allows to define a polynomial basis (a ``FaustPoly``) using the function ``pyfaust.poly.basis``. Currently, only Chebyshev polynomials are supported but others are yet to come. Below is the prototype of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```basis(L, K, basis_name, dev='cpu', T0=None)```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next, we shall see a simple example but I let you consult the documentation by typing ``help(pyfaust.poly.basis)`` to get more details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you want to instantiate a basis Faust of dimension K+1 (in the example below K=5) on L, which by the way must be a ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`` at least square (and most likely symmetric positive definite in much use cases),  you'll make this call to the function:\n"

This is not suprising, because the 0-degree Chebyshev polynomial is the identity. However, note that the ``T0`` optional argument of the function is here to trick the basis by using another matrix than the identity even if eventually it might not be a proper basis it can be useful if you want to apply this basis on a vector or a matrix (hence you'll set ``T0`` as this vector/matrix instead of multiplying the basis by this vector/matrix).  \n",
    "\n",

In the code below F is cloned to a classic Faust G and the time of the multiplication by a matrix is measured in both cases (with F, the basis Faust and G its classic Faust copy).

To get a classic Faust the only way is to copy the Faust factor by factor."

Doing with the latter an optimized implementation is used whose the memory footprint is smaller than the one consumed with a ``FaustPoly``.
