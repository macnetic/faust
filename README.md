# FAuST Toolbox -- Flexible Approximate Multi-Layer Sparse Transform


General purpose
===============

The FAuST toolbox contains a C++ code implementing a general framework
designed to factorize matrices of interest into multiple sparse factors.
It contains a template CPU/GPU C++ code and a Matlab wrapper.
The algorithms implemented here are described in details in [1]- Le Magoarou

For more information on the FAuST Project, please visit the website of the
project: [FAÂµST website](http://faust.inria.fr)

Installation
============

Please refer to the document "./gettingStartedFAuST-version2_0.pdf"
to install the FAUST toolbox.
The FAUST toolbox has been tested on the following environments:
- LINUX (fedora 20, 21, 22, 23 / Ubuntu)
- MACOS X
- WINDOWS (windows 7)

Quick install on UNIX
=====================

	Unpack the directory.
	mkdir ./build
	cd ./build
	cmake .. OR ccmake .. (with Graphical User Interface)
	make
	make install

**Warning**:
The Matlab interface of FAuST requires compiling mex files. The mex compiler
compatible with specific versions of gcc depending on the platform used.
