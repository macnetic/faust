class Faust:
    """FAÂµST Python class.
     This class represents a given dense matrix by a product of sparse matrices
     (i.e. Faust).
     The main goal of Faust representation is to speed up operations on that
     matrix, especially the multiplication. Besides the time optimization, a Faust
     can reduce the memory space size needed both for storage and loading.

     Although the sparse matrices are more interesting for optimization it's not
     forbidden to define a Faust as a product of dense matrices or a mix of dense
     and sparse matrices.

     The matrices composing the Faust product, also called the factors, are
     defined on complex or real fields. Hence a Faust can be a complex Faust or a
     real Faust.

     A Faust has ideally to be seen and used as a numpy dense matrix/array, but
     this matrix exists only virtually and is actually represented by its factors.
     In order to use a Faust like a numpy matrix, a certain number of Python
     built-ins available for numpy matrices are implemented in this class but take
     note that not all are.

     You have the capability to retrieve the dense matrix with the
     method Faust.toarray but it will cost the multiplication of the Faust's factors.
     It's noteworthy that in this documentation the expression 'dense matrix'
     designates the numpy dense matrix corresponding to a Faust, that is the
     matrix obtained by the multiplication of the
     previously mentioned Faust's factors.

     Likewise, other Faust's methods need to calculate the factor product, and
     they will be indicated with a warning in this documentation. You should avoid
     to use them if it's not really necessary (for example you might limit their use
     to test purposes).

     Other important limitation is that contrary to a numpy dense matrix
     a Faust is immutable. It means that you cannot affect elements of a Faust using
     the affectation operator `=' like you do with a numpy matrix (e.g. `M[i,j] =
     2').
     That limitation is the reason why the Python built-in `__setitem__()' is not
     implemented in this class.

            Another easy way to create a Faust is to call the static method Faust.randFaust().
